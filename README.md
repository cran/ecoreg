# ecoreg: R package for ecological regression

This is the development repository for the CRAN package [ecoreg](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ecoreg) for ecological regression using aggregate and individual data.

There are no plans to add new features to this package.

Bugs will still be fixed, and CRAN requirements will be adhered to.

This repository only includes CRAN versions 0.2.2 (2017-08-24) and onwards.
